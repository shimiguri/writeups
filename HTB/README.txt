Whenever I do a box ill try to include it here, ill only post writeups in which i was able to get both flags (user, system)... <br>
If you want a specific box done or you have some feedback regarding a writeup, dm me on discord and ill see what can be done.

P.S 
If you are interested in web-hacking check out HTB if you havent already, its a great platform with a lot to offer both beginners/intermediate and experts
